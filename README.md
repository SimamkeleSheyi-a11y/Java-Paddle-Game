# Java-Paddle-Game
This is a clean and smooth Java Paddle Game built using Swing. Features modern controls, collision physics, scoring, increasing difficulty, and a restart system. Fully object-based and optimized for 60 FPS.

This program creates a full paddle-style arcade game using Java Swing. It uses a custom JPanel called PaddleGame, which acts as both the game screen and the main controller for gameplay logic. The window is set to 800×600, and the player controls a horizontal paddle near the bottom of the screen.

The game defines several constant values upfront: window size, paddle dimensions, ball size, paddle speed, and the initial speed of the ball. The paddle position, ball position, ball velocity, score, and game-over state are all tracked by instance variables.

Keyboard input is handled using a HashSet that stores the keys currently pressed, allowing smooth movement when keys are held down. The game listens for left/right or A/D keys to move the paddle, and if the game has ended, pressing the spacebar resets everything.

The game loop is controlled by a Timer running at 60 frames per second. Each tick updates the game state and repaints the graphics. The resetGame() method centers the paddle and ball and assigns the ball a random initial direction based on a generated angle. Its velocity is calculated using cosine and sine components multiplied by the ball speed.

During gameplay updates, the paddle moves according to keyboard input but is prevented from leaving the screen. The ball moves independently, bouncing off the left and right walls and the top boundary. The collision detection checks if the ball hits the paddle rectangle at the bottom of the screen. When the ball connects with the paddle, the vertical velocity reverses, horizontal velocity adjusts depending on where the ball hits the paddle, and the ball gradually becomes faster. Each successful hit increases the score.

If the ball passes below the paddle area, the game enters a game over state.

The drawing logic uses Graphics2D with anti-aliasing for smooth visuals. If the game is active, it draws the paddle, the ball, the score, and a hint for the controls. If the game is over, a centered “Game Over” screen is shown along with the final score and instructions to press space to restart.

Finally, the main method sets up a JFrame, attaches the PaddleGame panel, and displays the window properly centered on the screen. The game starts immediately and is ready for player input
